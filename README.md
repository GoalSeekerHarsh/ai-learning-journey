# 🚀 AI Learning Journey

**Author:** Harsh  
**Start Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Goal:** Become an AI Generalist (Beginner → Advanced)  
**Timeline:** 12-18 months (Moderate pace)

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my complete journey from beginner to AI generalist. I'm learning:
- Mathematics for AI (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability)
- Machine Learning (Classical ML, Deep Learning, LLMs)
- Practical Skills (Data Engineering, MLOps, Deployment)
- Research Literacy (Reading & implementing papers)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, C++ (for DSA background)  
**Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
**Tools:** Jupyter, Git, VS Code, Docker  
**Hardware:** Mac M1/M2 (Apple Silicon optimized)
